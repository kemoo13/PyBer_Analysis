# Pyber_Analysis

## Background

The PyBer company needs the 2019 ride-share data analyzed in order to determine the average weekly fares for each city type. The purpose of this analysis is to help Pyber improve the access of their ride-share company as well as to determine the affordability of these services to underserved neighborhoods. In order to perform this analysis, the following information for each city type was gathered:

-	The total number of rides for each city type
-	The total number of drivers for each city type
-	The sum of the fares for each city type
-	The average fare per ride for each city type
-	The average fare per rider for each city type

## Results

The analysis of the PyBer 2019 ride-share data showed that the majority of ride-share occurs within the urban city type. The urban neighborhoods make up more than two-thirds (68.4%) of the total rides by city type. Suburban areas account for almost a third of the total at 26.3% while the rural areas account for only a fraction of that, with a mere 5.3% of the total rides by city type.

It is expected that the urban area would have the highest percentage of total rides due to the high population of urban areas in comparison to the other city types. To further understand what may be causing the large difference in the number of rides for each city type, the number of drivers per city type was analyzed. This data showed that there are significantly more drivers within the urban areas than in both the suburban and rural areas combined. The urban cities account for 80.9% of the total drivers for PyBer. Similar to total rides, suburban areas come second with 16.5%, and the rural areas only makeup 2.6% of all PyBer drivers.

The data was then further collected by city type to produce a summary table in order to visualize the overall data. Urban cities not only had a higher number of total rides and total drivers, but they also made significantly more money overall. Though urban citiesâ€™ total fares are much higher, their average fare per ride ($24.53) and average fare per driver ($16.57) is lower than both the suburban and rural cities as shown below.

A bubble chart was produced in order to show a visual representation of the relationship between the average fare and the total number of rides per city type:

The PyBer dataframe was resampled by date in order to produce a line chart of the total fare by city type by date.  From this chart, a visual representation of the month by month total fares for each city type where the peaks and dips represent different weeks.
